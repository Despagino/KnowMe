                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Outgoing, adventorous, and hospitable are some things that I would describe myself. I
                    love
                    looking at all the perspectives of every situation. The world has so much to offer so why not look
                    and travel it? I love learning about history and how everything came to existence. Besides all that
                    fanatic stuff, I love making new friends and socializing and eating good food. Bad food will make
                    the mood go bad. </p>

                <h2>Greatest Lesson</h2>
                <p>I realized at a young age that life is fragile. When I was 13, my dad (a missionary) was assigned in
                    Tacloban,
                    Leyte, Philippines. In this time, the strongest Typhoon ever recorded, Typhoon " Haiyan" had just
                    devoured
                    Tacloban and my family and I were in the heart of the aftermath. Many people lost their loved ones.
                    I'm
                    talking
                    about hundreds and thousands of lives were lost. This was the greatest lesson I've ever received,
                    that life
                    will
                    always be needed to be treasured and appreciated.</p>

                <h2>My Passion</h2>
                <p>I am
                    huge
                    basketball fanatic. Being from the Bay Area since I was a kid, the Warriors will always be my
                    favorite
                    basketball team. Aside from watching basketball, I also was a Point Guard from Chicago Academy
                    High
                    School.
                    Staying fit, learning new tech, travelling and eating good food are what keeps the gears moving.
                    Above all,
                    family is something that I treasure the most. Being a twin, life will always be interesting and
                    somewhat
                    entertaining from all the questions I get if I'm Jules or Gino.</p>
